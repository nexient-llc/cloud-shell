# Azure Shell Functions
- This directory contains shell functions for Azure
- There are two top-level categories of shell functions:
  - `applications`: Shell functions used to consume an existing service
  - `platforms`: Shell functions used to provide a new service
- Shell functions used for both purposes (if any) should be placed in a `common` folder
