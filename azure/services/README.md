# Azure Services
- This folder contains templates and example values for Azure services
- There are two top-level categories of templates and example values:
  - `applications`: Templates and example values that consume an existing service
  - `platforms`: Templates and example values that provide a new service
- Templates and example values used for both purposes (if any) should be placed in a `common` folder
